## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- My personal portfolio and blog ([discoverlance](https://discoverlance.com))

- I am also working on releasing a personal startup project (cloudatrest / babycloud) to discuss all things cloud and application development

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Vue.JS
- Nuxt.JS
- Improving my javascript skills
- AWS Application development (hoping to go for the AWS Associate Developer certification soon)

## âš¡ Fun facts
- I really love daily.dev and as you can see my **Dev Card** above.
- I am a huge fan of anime and am currently binging **One Piece*.
